# Activities and Tasks
1. Your job is to create a database model for this situation. The model must contain three tables. a) The first two tables will contain the columns that are in the orange bubble. Each column can exist in exactly one table! b) The third table will contain columns of your choice, but we must be able to tell how many times a teenager Lakshmi visited the camp in last 3 years.
2. Create a script that will populate one of your tables with a Price Camp Title random 5000 people. Out of these 5000, 65% should be girls and 35% should be boys. Out of these 5000, 18% should be between 7 and 12 years old, 27% should be 13 to14, 20% should be 15-17 and the rest could be any age up to 19 years old.
3. Write a query that can output data in a format so that following chart can be drawn. The number in the chart are indicative

# Features
* **Relational Database Design:** Structured data into three tables for efficient storage and retrieval.
* **Automated Data Population:** Generated a dataset of 5000 participants with predefined demographic distribution.
* **Camp Attendance Tracking:** Enabled tracking of participant history over multiple years.
* **Gender & Age Group Analysis:** Provided insights into participant distribution across age groups and generations.

# Dashboard Overview
The dashboard presents a visual representation of key insights, including:
* Gender distribution of participants.
* Age-based segmentation of attendees.
* Frequency of camp visits over the past three years.
* Graphical representation of participation across generations.
